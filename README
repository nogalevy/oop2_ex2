General Description of the Assignment:
    In this assignment we needed to implement a Form that the user must fill
    the fields of until all inputed data meets the requirements. The program
    begins by creating the required fields and validators. Once they are created,
    in a loop, the user is asked to fill the required fields untill the form
    is correctly filled.

Design:
    Classes: Form, BaseField, Field, BaseValidator, IdValidator, MinValidator, 
             NoDigitValidator, RangeValidator, BaseFormValidator, 
             Courses2YearValidator, Faculty2YearValidator, FacultyValue

    Form:
        - responsible for filling out and validating the required fields
    BaseField:
        - base class for Field
    Field:
        - template class responsible for filling out the required fields and checking validity
    BaseValidator:
        - base template class for validators of fields
        - IdValidator, MinValidator, NoDigitValidator, and RangeValidator inherit
          from this base class
    IdValidator:
        - validates the answer given to the field is a valid ID
    MinValidator:
        - validates that the answer given to the field is more than the predetermined
          minimum value
    NoDigitValidator:
        - validates that the answer given does not contain digits
    RangeValidator:
        - validates that the answer given is within a predetermined range
    BaseFormValidator:
        - base class for validators of 2 fields in a form
        - Courses2YearValidator and Faculty2YearValidator inherit from this base class
    Courses2YearValidator:
        - template class validates that the number of courses given alligns with the year given
    Faculty2YearValidator:
        - template class validates that the year given is within the facultys' program length
    FacultyValue:
        - class that represents the different facultys and their integer value
        - defines operators on class
